### Description : Upcoming Plan for Learners 
`We have plenty of modules like esp32 and 8266 we don't have a single core board to make all work at one place so we planned to create PCB board, just need to add external modules (all microcontrollers + others) like "plug n play", so learners can fix manually without soldering it and they can remove after work done`

- 1. same like for other modules zigbee and zwave and ++++++++++++++++

- 2. vulnerable labs with flashing codes (BLE undergoing soon others will come) +++++

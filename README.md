### Description : Upcoming Plan for Learners 
`We have plenty of modules like esp32 and 8266 we don't have a single core board to make all work at one place so we planned to create pcb board, just need tp add external modules like plug n play, people can fix manually without soldering and remove later work done`

- 1. same like for other modules zigbee and zwave and ,, 

- 2. vulnerable labs with flashing codes
